                <h2 className="about-section-title">Welcome to Butter & Batter!</h2>
                <br/>
                <p className="about-paragraph">At Butter and Batter, we believe in the magic of family, tradition, and the joy that comes from a warm, freshly baked treat. Our bakery is not just a business; 
                    it’s a family legacy that has been kneaded, rolled, and lovingly baked into every loaf, pastry, and cake that comes out of our oven.</p>

                <h2 className="about-section-title">Our Story</h2>
                <br/>
                <p className="about-paragraph">Butter and Batter began as a small, dream-fueled kitchen project by our founders, [Founder's Names]. With a passion for baking and a desire to share the simple pleasures of 
                    home-baked goods, they opened our doors in 2022. What started as a humble neighborhood bakery has grown into a beloved community hub where friends and families gather to 
                    enjoy delicious, handcrafted baked goods.</p>
                <br/>
